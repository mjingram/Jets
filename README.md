to your staff and assign them to different planes. You can fire the bad pilots or change which planes they are flying. There are 3 differnt categories of planes availble including Fighter Jet, Commercial Jets and UFOs. Each category of jets has different functions. Commercial jets allow you load passengers while UFOs and Fighters jets are combart ready! 

When you are done you can write your jets to a file.
